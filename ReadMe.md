# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms in C++, designed to help in learning and mastering them.

## Getting Started
To run the code, you will need a C++ compiler like g++. Ensure that your environment is set up correctly for compiling and running C++ code. Some implementations may have specific dependencies, which will be listed in the respective folder's README.md.

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured into folders, each representing a different data structure or algorithm category. Each folder may contain multiple implementation files and its own README.md for detailed information.

## Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

## Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-data-structures-algorithms.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory of your choice.

```
cd DSA/sorting
```

3. Compile and run the program.

```bash
g++ quick_sort.cpp -o quick_sort
./quick_sort
```
